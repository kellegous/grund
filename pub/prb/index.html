  On Google+, I asked the following question:
  <blockquote>
    I'm going to run this contest where I call N of your friends and ask them to pick a number between 1 and 100. If any of your friends pick the same number, I give you $100. If none of them pick the same number, I give you nothing. Each friend will cost you $1. How many friends do you want me to call?

  The problem got stuck in my head on that Sunday because I was trying to think of
  problems that would demonstrate the extent to which our intuition misleads us when
  a question involves expected value. It's not a great example, but it stuck in my head
  until I sat down and did the math.

  This is actually just the class <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">birthday problem</a> with an expected value component tacked on. If you look at that Wikipedia page, you'll understand why the probability of winning looks like this. The reason this is a &ldquo;classic&rdquo; is because the probability grows much faster that intuition would suggest.

  To determine the number of friends to call, we're looking to maximize <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected value</a>. That's just P(win) * $100 - cost (# of friends). Plotting the expected value, it is clear that there is a point where adding more friends will not do much to increase the chance of winning, but it will cost more. That sweet spot is at around <strong>25 friends</strong>. That makes the cost, of course, is a mere $25 and the chance of winning is 95%.
