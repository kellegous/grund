  This is just the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">birthday problem</a> in disguise, so the probability of winning as function of the number of friends you call looks like this.

  If I then use that to compute the expected value as P(win) * $100 - cost (# of friends). Is it not correct to conclude that I want to call <strong>25 friends</strong>, which gives me a 95% chance of winning at a cost of just $25 (with an expected value of just over $71?
